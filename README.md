# Legal Stuff
This is an unofficial implementation of the [Red Clearance Starter Set of Paranoia](https://www.mongoosepublishing.com/products/paranoia-red-clearance-starter-set-1) by Mongoose Publishing for Foundry VTT.

It's made by me, for my gaming group and is not officially sanctioned in any way, shape, or form.

The system aspires to contain no proprietary content and requires the usage of physical or digital rule books to use.
